              p
              {
                color:red;
                font-size:30px
              }            
            </style>

# Overriding styling
  - The later declaration of a value will override the previous ones.
  - This works even on the included style sheets .. the later file included ' vlues will override the values 
    of the previous ones. 
  - The inline-styling is the most powerful one.
  - It can used to overwrite some values in frameworks like bootstrap by including the overwriting file after 
    it

# id & class
  - In .css :
    #id_name {}
    .class_name {}

# Div properties
  - background-color: red || #FF0056 || rgb(255,220,126) || rgba(255,210,21,0.2 : opicity);
  - background-image: url('path/to/image');
  - background-repeat: repeat(default) || no-repeat || repeat-x || repeat-y >> modify the repeat action of the 
    photo in a div bigger than the photo.
