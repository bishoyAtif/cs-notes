//General CSS Rule
- selector {
    property:value;
    anoterProperty:value;
  }

//How to use CSS with HTML?
- <link href="path/to/file" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"> //StyleSheets
- <p style="color:red;font-size:30px">This is a paragraph</p> //Inline
- <style> //Style Tag
    p
    {
      color:red;
      font-size:30px
    }            
  </style>

//Selectors
- element {}              //Type Selectors.
- #id {}                  //Selects an element with an id.
- .class {}               //Selects the element(s) with a specific class.
- * {}                    //Select every element in the page.
- parent descendant {}    //Selects the element under a specific parent.
- element + adjacent {}   //Selects the adjacent "the element after" of the element
- a[attribute="value"] {} //Selects an element with a specific attribute.
- a[attribute="value"][attribute="value"] //Selects elements with multiple attributes.
- element:nth-of-type(order) //Selects the nth element.

//Colors in CSS
- RGB: rgb(red, green, blue);
- HEX: #FF0055;
- RGBA: rgba(red, green, blue, trasparent "0->1")
- Absolute: red, green, purple and black.

//Inheritance Concept
- Any Selector applied on a parent of many nodes affects all the children nodes.
- If element styling is made, it will overwrite the inherited style from the parent.

//Specificity
- Type < Type Type < class < attribute < psudo class < id < inline
- ul < ul li < .highlighted < input[type="text"] < li:hover < #specific < <h1 style=""></h1>

# Overriding styling
  - The later declaration of a value will override the previous ones.
  - This works even on the included style sheets .. the later file included ' vlues will override the values 
    of the previous ones. 
  - The inline-styling is the most powerful one.
  - It can used to overwrite some values in frameworks like bootstrap by including the overwriting file after 
    it


//Background
- background-color.

- background-image: url('path/to/image');

- background-repeat: repeat(default) || no-repeat || repeat-x || repeat-y 

- backfround-attachment: scroll(default) || fixed

- background-position: X% Y% >> makes the center of the background image as a percentage of the div height 
  and width.

- background-size:
  1- cover //Stretches the image to cover all the html vertically and at least the the page full screen. 
  2- contain //Resizes to contain all your html entities.

- background: url() || none _ repeat mode _ Position _ Attachment _ Color //One line declaration.

//Border
border: widthpx color style; 

//Font Properties
- font-size: ?px | ?em //Takes a ratio of the font-size of the parent element.
- font-family: "Arial"
- font-weight: normal "default" | bold
- line-height: ?;

# Text properties
  - direction: ltr | rtl  
  - Letter spacing
  - text-decoration: underline | overline | line-through | blink
  - text-transform: uppercase | lowercase | capitalize | inherit | initial
  - text-align: center | left | right
  
//Psudo Selectors 
- element:hover //Selects the element when hovering over it.
- a:visited //select the element when visiting a link.
- input:checked //select the checkbox or the radio button when checked.
- p::first-letter //Checks the first letter of the element.

//CSS Box Model
- Each element is represented as a rectangular box, with the box's content, padding, border, and margin built up around one 
  another like the layers of an onion.

1- width, height //Sets the size of the content box.
   width property can be a ratio of its parent element. width: 30%;  
2- padding represents the inner margin of a CSS box â€” the layer between the outer edge of the content box and the inner edge 
   of the border. 
3- border is sitting between the outer edge of the padding and the inner edge of the margin.
4- The margin represents the outer area surrounding the CSS box, which pushes up against other CSS boxes in the layout.

- You can manipulate margin, border and padding by using these properties. margin, margin-top, border, padding-left and so on
- Shortcut for declaring the four sides. "margin: ?px ?px ?px ?px" clockwise from the top.
- Use auto for the side that you want css to style it dynamically.
- "margin: 1px 2px" will make the top and the bottom sides 1px margin and will make the left and the right sides 2px marign.

//Float
- The float CSS property specifies that an element should be placed along the left or right side of its container
