                                      ------------------------------------
- You should think as if there is a box around each CSS element.
  For the block-level elements, The box takes all the line it is on. But the inline-level elements can be part of the line.

- CSS associates rules "Styles" with HTML elements.
- CSS Rule contains a selector and a declaration, e.g.
  p { // Selector 
    font-family: Arial; // Declaration, Property: Value
  }
  Selector indicates which element to apply the rule, Declaration indicates how this element should be styled.

// Adding CSS to HTML
- <link href="path/to/file" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"> //Associating HTML with CSS file.

- <p style="color:red;font-size:30px">This is a paragraph</p> //Inline

- <style> //Internal
    p {
      color:red;
      font-size:30px
    }            
  </style>

// Selectors
! CSS Selectors are case sensitive.

- * {}                    // "Universal Selector" Select every element in the page.

- element, another-element {}              // Selects all elements written.

- .cls {} // Selects all elements with class "cls"
- p.cls {} // Selects all p elements with class "cls"

- #id {}                  //Selects an element with an id.

- element>child {} // Selects the child for the element but don't select the element itself.

- parent descendant {}    //Selects the elements under a specific parent recursively.

- element + adjacent {}   //Selects the first adjacent "the element after" of the element

- element ~ adjacent {}   //Selects all the adjacent elements of the element.

- a[attribute="value"] {} //Selects an element with a specific attribute.

- a[attribute="value"][attribute="value"] //Selects elements with multiple attributes.

- element:nth-of-type(order) //Selects the nth element.

// Last Rule
- The latter declaration of a value will override the previous ones.
- This works even on the included style sheets .. the latter file included will override the declarations 
  of the previous ones. 
- It can used to overwrite some values in frameworks like bootstrap by including the overwriting file after 
  it

// Specificity
- Type < Type Type < class < attribute < psudo class < id < inline
- ul < ul li < .highlighted < input[type="text"] < li:hover < #specific < <h1 style=""></h1>

// Important
- You can add !important after any property value to indicate that it should be considered more important than other rules that apply to the same element.
  p b { color:red !important }

//Inheritance
- Any rule applied on a parent of many nodes affects all the children nodes.
- If element styling is made, it will overwrite the inherited style from the parent "Specificity".
- Some rules can't be inherited like border. But you can make the descendant inherit it by using inherit keyword after the rule.
  body {border: 1px solid black}
  p {border: inherit}

// Why should I use style sheets ?
- All of your web pages can share the same style sheet by using the <link> element on each HTML page of your site to link to the same CSS document.
- The HTML code will be easier to read and edit because it does not have lots of CSS rules.

- You should test your CSS styles on many browsers to debug any unexpected browser quirk that might happen.

- background-image: url('path/to/image');

- background-repeat: repeat(default) || no-repeat || repeat-x || repeat-y 

- backfround-attachment: scroll(default) || fixed

- background-position: X% Y% >> makes the center of the background image as a percentage of the div height 
  and width.

- background-size:
  1- cover //Stretches the image to cover all the html vertically and at least the the page full screen. 
  2- contain //Resizes to contain all your html entities.

- background: url() || none _ repeat mode _ Position _ Attachment _ Color //One line declaration.

//Border
border: widthpx color style; 

//Font size units
- ?px
- ?em  //Takes a ratio of the font-size of the parent element.
- ?rem //Takes a ratio of the root element.
//Font Properties
- font-size: ? 
- font-family: "Arial"
- font-weight: normal "default" | bold
- line-height: ?;

# Text properties
  - direction: ltr | rtl  
  - Letter spacing
  - text-decoration: underline | overline | line-through | blink
  - text-transform: uppercase | lowercase | capitalize | inherit | initial
  - text-align: center | left | right
  
//Psudo Selectors 
- element:hover //Selects the element when hovering over it.
- a:visited //select the element when visiting a link.
- input:checked //select the checkbox or the radio button when checked.
- p::first-letter //Checks the first letter of the element.

//CSS Box Model
- Each element is represented as a rectangular box, with the box's content, padding, border, and margin built up around one another like the layers of an onion.

1- width, height //Sets the size of the content box.
   width property can be a ratio of its parent element. width: 30%;  
2- padding represents the inner margin of a CSS box â€” the layer between the outer edge of the content box and the inner edge 
   of the border. 
3- border is sitting between the outer edge of the padding and the inner edge of the margin.
4- The margin represents the outer area surrounding the CSS box, which pushes up against other CSS boxes in the layout.

- You can manipulate margin, border and padding by using these properties. margin, margin-top, border, padding-left and so on
- Shortcut for declaring the four sides. "margin: ?px ?px ?px ?px" clockwise from the top.
- Use auto for the side that you want css to style it dynamically.
- "margin: 1px 2px" will make the top and the bottom sides 1px margin and will make the left and the right sides 2px marign.

//Float
- The float CSS property specifies that an element should be placed along the left or right side of its container
- It makes the element doesn't belong to and the order in its container. It makes the element float in its container.
